Code to predict magnetic shielding tensor of atoms in a molecular enviornment. Currently, the code uses DNN regression and atom centered atom pairs as features.
However, the predicitions are not accurate enough and the code will be re-written to use smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) which captures the local atomic enviornement better, and may lead to more accurate predicition.
